## What is RStudio Cloud?

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img src="img/rstudio-cloud.png" title="Screenshot of the RStudio IDE in RStudio Cloud in a browser." alt="Screenshot of the RStudio IDE in RStudio Cloud in a browser." width="100%" /&gt;

---

## Why RStudio Cloud?

- Does not require IT support

--
- Git works out of the box
- Knit to PDF and Word works out of the box

--
- Features designed for instructors

---

## Contexts

- Shorter workshops: Likely no opportunity to communicate pre-workshop instructions, varied computing background and learning goals

- Semester long courses
  - Intro data science / statistics: little to no background in stats, data science, programming
  - Upper level data science / statistics: Varied computing background and different computer setups

---

## RStudio Cloud: First look

&lt;img src="img/landing-1.png" title="Screenshot of the landing page for RStudio Cloud with no projects." alt="Screenshot of the landing page for RStudio Cloud with no projects." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Workspaces

- When you create an account on RStudio Cloud you get a workspace of your own

- You can add a new workspace and control its permissions

- Projects in either workspace can be public or private

---

## A framework for workspaces

&lt;img src="img/landing-2.png" title="Screenshot of the landing page for RStudio Cloud with no projects, annotated with additional images. The sidebar is where workspaces are shown has a picture of a classroom and the middle area where projects in the workspace called 'your workspace' has a picture of a sandbox." alt="Screenshot of the landing page for RStudio Cloud with no projects, annotated with additional images.

## Projects

.pull-left[
A new project in RStudio Cloud
&lt;img src="img/new-project-cloud.png" title="Screenshot of RStudio Cloud with the 'New project' button highlighted." alt="Screenshot of RStudio Cloud with the 'New project' button highlighted." width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.alert[
**PSA:** If you use RStudio, use projects! Trust me, you won’t regret it. Find out more on [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html).

## Projects from Git

]

Both options `clone` a Git repo

---

## Sharing options

- Option 1: Share a single project

- Option 2: Invite users to a workspace (presumably with many projects)

## 👩‍🏫 Creating and sharing a single project

&lt;br&gt;

.discussion[

**Follow along!**

- Create a new project and give it a name
- Install a package of your choice
- Create a template R Markdown document in the project
- Change the access level of the project so others can see it as well
- *Optional:* Copy the project URL and share it with the rest of the group in the chat
]

---

## Pros / cons: Sharing a single project

.pull-left[
### Good!

- Students land directly in a project upon login
- Works well for workshops where all work will be completed in a single project
- Also great for sharing code in general, e.g. collaboration, reprexes, etc.
]
--
.pull-right[
### Not so good...

- Students need to remember to make a copy of the project (which means you need to remember to remind them!)
- You can't keep track which students started their assignment
- Students control permissions
- You can't easily peek into student projects -- they would need to explicitly share the project with you

## 👩‍🏫 Workspace membership

## 👩‍🏫 Role permissions

&lt;br&gt;

| role        | permission                                       | course role |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| admin       | manage users, view, edit and manage all projects | instructor  |
| moderator   | view, edit and manage all projects               | TA          |
| contributor | create, edit and manage their own projects       | student     |
| viewer      | view projects shared with everyone               | auditor     |

---

## 👩‍🏫 Other permissions

&lt;br&gt;

#### Under the Members tab:

.pull-left-narrow[
&lt;img src="img/permissions.png" width="100%" /&gt;
]
.pull-right-wide[
- By default, all permissions are turned off
- Think carefully before checking these boxes

- Make workspace shared for a short period of time, share link with students, enrol them as contributors.
- After initial round of enrolment (e.g. drop/add) switch over to this access level
- Use invitations for visitors added mid-semester

## Base projects

One of the most attractive features of RStudio Cloud!

- Packages you want *installed* on all student projects

--
- Text documents you want to appear on **all** student projects (e.g. code of conduct, turn-in instructions, etc.)

--
- Applies to all projects created **after** base project has been specified, doesn't apply retroactively

--
- Can be updated as many times as you like throughout the course (without having to convince your IT!!!)

]

---

## Git integration

🛑 Only relevant if teaching with Git &amp; GitHub!

--

😁 Base project template can be used, so new project from Git also has the right packages installed!

---

## Pros / cons: Sharing a workspace

.pull-left[
### Good!

- Various permission levels
- Base projects with desired packages installed
- Assignments -- no more "make a copy of the project before starting work"
- Peek into students’ projects
&lt;img src="img/view-derived-projects.png" title="Screenshot of RStudio Cloud workspace with many shared projects. Highlighted is information on one of these screens that reads 'View 17 derived projects'." alt="Screenshot of RStudio Cloud workspace with many shared projects. Highlighted is information on one of these screens that reads 'View 17 derived projects'." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
--
.pull-right[
### Not so good...

- Students land in the workspace, may need to provide instructions for the next steps
- Git config for each project can get tedious and doesn't reflect realistic practice
]

---

## Common pitfalls

- Changes you make after student launches a project under either model (single project or workspace) won’t propagate to their project

--

- Packages in the base project will be **installed** in all projects in the workspace, but not **loaded**
  - If you need students to run code in the Console that requires a package, your instructions should remind them to load the package first
  - If using Rmd document, add a `load-package` chunk on top

# Parting remarks

## Tips

- Each project is allocated 1GB of RAM (but you can increase this!)
  - Test things out before assignments involving large datasets 

- What your students see is not always what you see
  - Create a secondary account and add as a student

---

## More tips

Make brief screencasts for getting students oriented with the platform (especially if remote teaching), or use mine!

## 📦 rscloud

- You can access RStudio Cloud's API to manage space members programatically using the **rscloud** package:

- You will need to create client credentials to use the package. You can create credentials at [login.rstudio.cloud/identity](https://login.rstudio.cloud/identity).


```r
