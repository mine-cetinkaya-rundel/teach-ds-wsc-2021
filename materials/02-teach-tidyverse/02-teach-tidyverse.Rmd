## What is the tidyverse?

The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

- **ggplot2** - data visualisation
- **dplyr** - data manipulation
- **tidyr** - tidy data
- **readr** - read rectangular data
- **purrr** - functional programming
- **tibble** - modern data frames
- **stringr** - string manipulation
- **forcats** - factors
- and many more ...

---

## Tidy data

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "tidy data diagram"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidy-data-frame.png")
```

1. Each variable must have its own column.
1. Each observation must have its own row.
1. Each value must have its own cell.

## Pipe operator (`magrittr`)

> I want to find my keys, then start my car, then drive to work, then park my car.

--

- Nested

```{r eval = FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "work"))
```

--

- **Piped**

```{r eval = FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "work") %>%
  park()
```

---

## `magrittr` vs native pipe

As of R 4.1.0 there is now a native pipe operator in R (`|>`) which is very similar to magrittr's (`%>%`).

For teaching purposes we would strongly recommend using magrittr for the foreseeable future.


- `|>` only supports piping to the first argument (no support for `.`)

- For most use cases, package dependencies are easier than R version dependencies

## Benefits of starting with the tidyverse

- More (human) readable syntax
- More consistent syntax
- Ease of multivariate visualizations
- Data tidying/rectangling without advanced programming
- Growth opportunities:
  - dplyr -> SQL
  - purrr -> functional programming

knitr::include_graphics("img/ggplot2-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```

# Start with ggplot2

---

## Why start with ggplot2?

--

1. Students come in with intuition for being able to interpret data visualizations without needing much instructions. 
  - Focus the majority of class time initially on syntax and leave interpretations to students. 
  - Later on the scale tips -- spend more class time on concepts and results interpretations and less on syntax.

--

1. It can be easier for students to detect mistakes in visualizations compared to those in wrangling or modeling. 
  
---

**Ex 1. It can be more difficult, especially for a new learner, to catch errors in data wrangling than in a data visualization.**

Suppose we want to find the average mileage of cars with more than 100 horsepower.

- Left: Incorrect because `hp` is numeric, but filtering is based on string comparison, note that no error is given.
- Right: Correct filtering, and note that reported mean is different.

.small[
.pull-left[
```{r wrong-filter, echo=TRUE, size = "small"}
mtcars %>%
  filter(hp > "100") %>%
  summarise(mean(mpg))
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r right-filter, echo=TRUE, size = "small"}
mtcars %>%
  filter(hp > 100) %>%
  summarise(mean(mpg))
```
]
]

---

**Ex 2. It can be difficult to catch modeling errors, again especially for new learners.** 

Fit a model predicting gas efficiency (`mpg`) from engine (`vs`, where `0` means V-shaped and `1` means straight). 
- Left: Incorrect, fit model where `vs` numeric
- Right: Correct, fit model where `vs` factor (categorical)
- Note: Slope estimates same.

.small[
.pull-left[
```{r model-binary-predictor-numeric, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, size="small"}
lm(mpg ~ vs, data = mtcars)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, size="small"}
m_bin_num <- lm(mpg ~ vs, data = mtcars)
tidy(m_bin_num) %>% 
  select(term, estimate) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  print(row.names = FALSE)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r model-binary-predictor-factor, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, size="small"}
lm(mpg ~ as.factor(vs), data = mtcars)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, size="small"}
m_bin_fac <- lm(mpg ~ as.factor(vs), data = mtcars)
tidy(m_bin_fac) %>% 
  select(term, estimate) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  print(row.names = FALSE)
```
]
]

---

**Ex 2. Continued**

Predict `mpg` from `gear` (the number of forward gears)

- Note: slope estimates are different for numeric (left) vs. categorical (right) `gear`
- Reason for difference may be obvious to someone who is already familiar with modeling and dummy variable encoding, but not to new learners

.small[
.pull-left[
```{r model-multilevel-predictor-numeric-fit, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, size="small"}
lm(mpg ~ gear, data = mtcars)
```
```{r model-multilevel-predictor-numeric-print, echo=FALSE, size="small"}
m_mul_num <- lm(mpg ~ gear, data = mtcars)
tidy(m_mul_num) %>% 
  select(term, estimate) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  print(row.names = FALSE)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r model-multilevel-predictor-factor-fit, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, size="small"}
lm(mpg ~ as.factor(gear), data = mtcars)
```
```{r model-multilevel-predictor-factor-print, echo=FALSE, size="small"}
m_mul_fac <- lm(mpg ~ as.factor(gear), data = mtcars)
tidy(m_mul_fac) %>% 
  select(term, estimate) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  print(row.names = FALSE)
```

# Reshaping data

---

## Instructional staff employment trends

The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is a nonprofit membership association of faculty and other academic professionals. [This report](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/AAUP_Report_InstrStaff-75-11_apr2013.pdf) by the AAUP shows trends in instructional staff employees between 1975 and 2011, and contains an image very similar to the one given below.

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.alt = "staff employment figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/staff-employment.png")
```

---

## Data

Each row in this dataset represents a faculty type, and the columns are the 
years for which we have data. The values are percentage of hires of that type 
of faculty for each year.

.small[
```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
staff
```
]

---

## Recreate the visualization

- In order to recreate this visualization we need to first reshape the data:
  - one variable for faculty type 
  - one variable for year
- Convert the data from the wide format to long format

--

.discussion[
How would you approach this problem?

- `gather()`/`spread()`
- `pivot_wider()`/ `pivot_longer()`
- Something else?
]

---

class: center, middle

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="80%",fig.align="center", fig.alt = "pivot friends meme"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pivot.gif")
```

---

## `pivot_*()` functions

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidyr-longer-wider.gif", fig.alt = "pivot function animation")
```

---

But before we do so... 

**Question:** If the long data will have a row for each year/faculty type combination, and there are 5 faculty types and 11 years of data, how many rows will the data have?

---

## `pivot_longer()`

```{r eval=FALSE}
pivot_longer(
  data, 
  cols,                # columns to pivot
  names_to = "name",   # name of new column for variable names
  values_to = "value"  # name of new column for values
  )
```

---

## Pivot staff data

.small[
```{r}
staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -faculty_type, 
    names_to = "year", 
    values_to = "percentage"
    ) %>%
  mutate(percentage = as.numeric(percentage))

staff_long
```
]

---

## Nope!

.midi[
```{r fig.height=2}
ggplot(staff_long, aes(x = percentage, y = year, color = faculty_type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```
]

---

## Meh

.midi[
```{r fig.height=2}
ggplot(staff_long, aes(x = percentage, y = year, fill = faculty_type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```
]

---

## Some improvement...

.midi[
```{r fig.height=2}
ggplot(staff_long, aes(x = percentage, y = year, fill = faculty_type)) +
  geom_col()
```
]

---

## More improvement

```{r staff-lines-2, echo = FALSE}
staff_long %>%
  mutate( 
    part_time = if_else(faculty_type == "Part-Time Faculty",
                        "Part-Time Faculty", "Other Faculty"),
    year = as.numeric(year)
    ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage/100, group = faculty_type, 
             color = part_time)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("gray", "red")) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent(accuracy = 1)) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Instructional staff employment trends",
    x = "Year", y = "Percentage", color = NULL

# When to purrr?

---

## Data manipulation with purrr (or not?)

- purrr is a package for functional programming with the tidyverse
- If you picked up the tidyverse ~3 years ago, purrr was commonly used for data science tasks that involve iteration
- In 2021, it's possible to do many of these data science tasks with dplyr and tidyr, which tend to me much more approachable to new learners

--

.discussion[
How familiar are you with the purrr package? Have you taught purrr in your data science courses?

## Ex 1. Flattening JSON files

We have data on lego sales and some information on the buyers in JSON format. We want to covert it into a tidy data frame.

.small[
```{r echo=FALSE}
sales <- read_rds("data/lego_sales.rds")
toJSON(sales[1], pretty = TRUE)
```
]

---

## purrr solution

```{r purr-solution, eval = FALSE}
sales %>%
  purrr::map_dfr(
    function(l) {
      purchases <- purrr::map_dfr(l$purchases, ~.)
      
      l$purchases <- NULL
      l$hobbies <- list(l$hobbies)
      
      cbind(as_tibble(l), purchases) %>% as_tibble()
    }
  )
```

---

## purr solution

```{r ref.label = "purr-solution", echo = FALSE}
```

---

## tidyr solution

```{r eval=FALSE}
sales %>%
  tibble(sales = .) %>%
  unnest_wider(sales) %>%
  unnest_longer(purchases) %>%
  unnest_wider(purchases)
```

---

## tidyr solution - Step 1

.small[
```{r}
sales %>%
  tibble(sales = .)
```
]

---

## tidyr solution - Step 2

.small[
```{r}
sales %>%
  tibble(sales = .) %>%
  unnest_wider(sales)
```
]

---

## tidyr solution - Step 3

.small[
```{r}
sales %>%
  tibble(sales = .) %>%
  unnest_wider(sales) %>%
  unnest_longer(purchases)
```
]

---

## tidyr solution - Step 4

.small[
```{r}
sales %>%
  tibble(sales = .) %>%
  unnest_wider(sales) %>%
  unnest_longer(purchases) %>%
  unnest_wider(purchases)
```
]

## dplyr 1.0.0

Another common use case for purrr has been working across rows and/or columns of a data frames.

Much of this functionality is now available directly in dplyr via the `across()` and `rowwise()` functions. Additional details and examples are availble in the vignettes:
- [column-wise operations vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/colwise.html)
- [row-wise operations vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/rowwise.html)

and the dplyr 1.0.0 release blog posts:

- [working across columns](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/dplyr-1-0-0-colwise/)
- [working within rows](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/dplyr-1-0-0-rowwise/)
