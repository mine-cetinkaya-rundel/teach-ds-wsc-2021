## What is the tidyverse?

The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

- **ggplot2** - data visualisation
- **dplyr** - data manipulation
- **tidyr** - tidy data
- **readr** - read rectangular data
- **purrr** - functional programming
- **tibble** - modern data frames
- **stringr** - string manipulation
- **forcats** - factors
- and many more ...

---

## Tidy data

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "tidy data diagram"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidy-data-frame.png")
```

1. Each variable must have its own column.

1. Each observation must have its own row.

1. Each value must have its own cell.

## Pipe operator (`magrittr`)

> I want to find my keys, then start my car, then drive to work, then park my car.

--

- Nested

```{r eval = FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "work"))
```

--

- **Piped**

```{r eval = FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "work") %>%
  park()
```

---

## `magrittr` vs native pipe

As of R 4.1.0 there is now a native pipe operator in R (`|>`) which is very similar to magrittr's (`%>%`).

For teaching purposes we would strongly recommend using magrittr for the foreseeable future.


- `|>` only supports piping to the first argument (no support for `.`)

- For most use cases, package dependencies are easier than R version dependencies

## Recoding a binary variable

.pull-left[
### Base R
```{r}
mtcars$transmission <-
  ifelse(
    mtcars$am == 0,
    "automatic",
    "manual"
  )
```
]
.pull-right[
### Tidyverse
```{r}
mtcars <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(
    transmission = case_when(
      am == 0 ~ "automatic",
      am == 1 ~ "manual"
    )
  )
```
]

---

## Recoding a multi-level variable

.pull-left[
### Base R
```{r}
mtcars$gear_char <-
  ifelse(
    mtcars$gear == 3,
    "three",
    ifelse(
      mtcars$gear == 4,
      "four",
      "five"
    )
  )
```
]
.pull-right[
### Tidyverse
```{r}
mtcars <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(
    gear_char = case_when(
      gear == 3 ~ "three",
      gear == 4 ~ "four",
      gear == 5 ~ "five"
    )
  )
```
]

---

## Visualising multiple variables

### Tidyverse

.small[
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.asp = 0.3, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(
  mtcars,
  aes(x = disp, y = mpg, color = transmission)
) +
  geom_point()
```
]

---

## Visualising even more variables

### Tidyverse

.small[
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.asp = 0.3, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(
  mtcars,
  aes(x = disp, y = mpg, color = transmission)
) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ cyl)
```
]

---

### Base R

.small[
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.asp = 0.3, fig.width = 8}
mtcars$trans_color <- ifelse(mtcars$transmission == "automatic", "green", "blue")
mtcars_cyl4 = mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4, ]
mtcars_cyl6 = mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 6, ]
mtcars_cyl8 = mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 8, ]
par(mfrow = c(1, 3), mar = c(2.5, 2.5, 2, 0), mgp = c(1.5, 0.5, 0))
plot(mpg ~ disp, data = mtcars_cyl4, col = trans_color, main = "Cyl 4")
plot(mpg ~ disp, data = mtcars_cyl6, col = trans_color, main = "Cyl 6")
plot(mpg ~ disp, data = mtcars_cyl8, col = trans_color, main = "Cyl 8")
legend("topright", legend = c("automatic", "manual"), pch = 1, col = c("green", "blue"))
```

## Benefits of starting with the tidyverse

- More (human) readable syntax

- More consistent syntax

- Ease of multivariate visualizations

- Data tidying/rectangling without advanced programming

- Growth opportunities:
  - dplyr -> SQL / Spark / etc
  - purrr -> functional programming
  - modeling -> tidymodels

# How tidyverse?

.discussion[
How do you start your lessons? Why?
- `library(tidyverse)` 
- `library(ggplot2)`, `library(dplyr)`, etc.

### .pink[ Sample slide ]

## ggplot2 $\in$ tidyverse

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ggplot2-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
- **ggplot2** is tidyverse's data visualization package
- The `gg` in "ggplot2" stands for Grammar of Graphics
- It is inspired by the book **Grammar of Graphics** by Leland Wilkinson
]

# Start with ggplot2

---

## Why start with ggplot2?

--

1. Students come in with intuition for being able to interpret data visualizations without needing much instructions.

  - Focus the majority of class time initially on syntax and leave interpretations to students. 
  - Later on the scale tips -- spend more class time on concepts and results interpretations and less on syntax.

--

1. It can be easier for students to detect mistakes in visualizations compared to those in wrangling or modeling.

---

## What next?

It depends on the course and subject matter, but generally data munging with dplyr is a good next step.

Some general guidance,
- Start with a small subset of verbs (e.g. `select()`, `filter()`, `mutate()`)

- Aim to quickly get to `group_by()` and `summarize()` as this is where the action is.

- Connecting munging back to data visualization tends to be more motivating than generating numerical summaries.

- Data cleaning provides opportunities to introduce additional packages (e.g. `stringr`, `forcats`)

# Reshaping data

---

## Instructional staff employment trends

The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is a nonprofit membership association of faculty and other academic professionals. [This report](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/AAUP_Report_InstrStaff-75-11_apr2013.pdf) by the AAUP shows trends in instructional staff employees between 1975 and 2011, and contains an image very similar to the one given below.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.alt = "staff employment figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/staff-employment.png")
```

---

## Data

Each row in this dataset represents a faculty type, and the columns are the 
years for which we have data. The values are percentage of hires of that type 
of faculty for each year.

.small[
```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE}
(staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv"))
```
]

---

## Recreate the visualization

- In order to recreate this visualization we need to first reshape the data:
  - one variable for faculty type 
  - one variable for year
  
- Convert the data from the wide format to long format

--

.discussion[
How would you approach this problem?

- `gather()`/`spread()`
- `pivot_wider()`/ `pivot_longer()`
- Something else?
]

---

class: center, middle

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="80%",fig.align="center", fig.alt = "pivot friends meme"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pivot.gif")
```

---

## `pivot_*()` functions

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.alt = "pivot function animation"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidyr-longer-wider.gif")
```

---

But before we do so... 

**Question:** If the long data will have a row for each year/faculty type combination, and there are 5 faculty types and 11 years of data, how many rows will the data have?

---

## Pivot staff data

.small[
```{r}
(staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -faculty_type,    # columns to pivot
    names_to = "year",       # name of new column for variable names
    values_to = "percentage" # name of new column for values
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    percentage = as.numeric(percentage)
  )
)
```
]

---

## Meh

.midi[
```{r fig.height=2}
ggplot(staff_long, aes(x = percentage, y = year, fill = faculty_type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```
]

---

## Some improvement...

.midi[
```{r fig.height=2}
ggplot(staff_long, aes(x = percentage, y = year, fill = faculty_type)) +
  geom_col()
```
]

---

## More improvement

```{r staff-lines-2, echo = FALSE}
staff_long %>%
  mutate( 
    part_time = if_else(faculty_type == "Part-Time Faculty",
                        "Part-Time Faculty", "Other Faculty"),
    year = as.numeric(year)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = year, y = percentage/100, group = faculty_type, color = part_time)
  ) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("gray", "red")) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent(accuracy = 1)) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Instructional staff employment trends",
    x = "Year", y = "Percentage", color = NULL
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

# When to purrr?

---

## Data manipulation with purrr (or not?)

- purrr is a package for functional programming with the tidyverse

- If you picked up the tidyverse >2 years ago, purrr was commonly used for data science tasks that involve iteration

- In 2021, it's possible to do many of these data science tasks with dplyr and tidyr, these approaches are often more approachable to new learners

--

.discussion[
How familiar are you with the purrr package? Have you taught purrr in your data science courses?

## Ex 1. Flattening JSON files

We have data on lego sales and some information on the buyers in JSON format. We want to covert it into a tidy data frame.

.tiny[
```{r}
sales <- read_rds("data/lego_sales.rds")
jsonlite::toJSON(sales[1], pretty = TRUE)
```
]

---

## purrr solution

.small[
```{r purrr-solution, eval = FALSE}
sales %>%
  purrr::map_dfr(
    function(l) {
      purchases <- purrr::map_dfr(l$purchases, ~.)
      l$purchases <- NULL
      
      bind_cols(as_tibble(l), purchases)
    }
  )
```
]

---

## purr solution

.small[
```{r ref.label = "purrr-solution", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## A tidyr solution

.small[
```{r test}
tibble(sales = sales) %>%
  unnest_wider(sales) %>%
  unnest_longer(purchases) %>%
  unnest_wider(purchases)
```
]

---

## tidyr solution (Step 1)

.small[
```{r}
tibble(sales = sales)
```
]

---

## tidyr solution (Step 2)

.small[
```{r}
tibble(sales = sales) %>%
  unnest_wider(sales)
```
]

---

## tidyr solution (Step 3)

.small[
```{r}
tibble(sales = sales) %>%
  unnest_wider(sales) %>%
  unnest_longer(purchases)
```
]

---

## tidyr solution (Step 4)

.small[
```{r}
tibble(sales = sales) %>%
  unnest_wider(sales) %>%
  unnest_longer(purchases) %>%
  unnest_wider(purchases)
```
]

---

## dplyr improvements

Another common use case for purrr has been working across rows and/or columns of a data frames.

Much of this functionality is now available directly in dplyr via the `across()` and `rowwise()` functions. Additional details and examples are availble in the vignettes:
- [column-wise operations vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/colwise.html)
- [row-wise operations vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/rowwise.html)

and the dplyr 1.0.0 release blog posts:

- [working across columns](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/dplyr-1-0-0-colwise/)
- [working within rows](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/dplyr-1-0-0-rowwise/)
